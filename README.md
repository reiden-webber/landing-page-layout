# Landing Page Layout
This repository contains my solution for The Odin Project’s Landing Page assignment. In this project, I design and build a complete multi-section landing page from scratch using HTML and CSS. The page structure and style are based on provided design images, and I used Flexbox to implement layout features.

## You’ll find...
- **Sectioned page structures:** header, feature sections, testimonial/review, and footer.
- **Flexbox layouts:** Practiced for aligning elements and creating responsive feeling (though full responsiveness is not required for this project).
- **Custom content:** You can substitute your own text or images, personalize the design, and choose your colors and fonts to showcase creativity.
- **Best practices:** Frequent commits, meaningful commit messages, and code organized in one CSS file.

## Based on the original template
<div style="text-align: center;">
  <img src="./img/layout.png" alt="Landing Page Layout" style="max-width: 500px;">
</div>
